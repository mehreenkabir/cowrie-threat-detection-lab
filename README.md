# Honeypot-Based Threat Detection Architecture with Splunk

## Overview

This project simulates a real-world threat detection architecture by integrating a Cowrie SSH honeypot with Splunk. 
The pipeline captures attacker interactions, forwards logs, and visualizes events in Splunk dashboards.
Detections are mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Mehreen Kabir** — a security analyst and engineer with a passion for catching bad actors before they know they’ve been spotted. 
I hold the **CompTIA CySA+** and **Splunk Core Certified User** certifications, and I specialize in turning raw telemetry into real-time threat intel.

## Why I Built This

This project is a hands-on example of the kind of detection and visibility work I love doing.
I didn’t just want to deploy a honeypot — 
I wanted to build a full architecture around it: collecting data, shipping logs securely, writing MITRE-aligned detections in Splunk, 
and visualizing it like a SOC would in the real world.
